# MythSim
## The Mythical CPU Simulator for Real Students

### Summary

MythSim is a visual microcode simulator. It can take microcode, along with program code and data stored in memory, and "run" the code, with the computed results being written to memory. The user can step through the program, observing the values in the registers and other major components. MythSim makes it much easier and less time-consuming to learn the details needed to succeed in a Computer Architecture course.
